# The Algorithm & Data Structure Hub üöÄ

[![Hacktoberfest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hacktoberfest-2025-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

Welcome to the Open-Source-DS-Algo! This repository is a community-driven collection of common algorithms and data structures implemented in various programming languages. It's a resource for learning and a place for developers to make their first meaningful open-source contributions.

## üåü Project Goals
The mission of this repository is to become a high-quality, community-curated resource for learning fundamental algorithms and data structures. While we enthusiastically participate in events like Hacktoberfest, our primary goal is to create a lasting educational tool for developers of all skill levels. We are committed to maintaining a high standard of quality for all contributions.

## üéÉ Your Guide to Contributing for Hacktoberfest

We are thrilled to welcome contributions from everyone, especially first-timers! To ensure a smooth and fair experience, please adhere to the following rules.

### Contribution Rules - PLEASE READ!

* ‚úÖ **DO** contribute an implementation of an algorithm or data structure that is not already in our collection for a specific language.
* ‚úÖ **DO** follow the required folder and file structure.
* ‚úÖ **DO** include comments in your code explaining the logic and its time/space complexity.
* ‚ùå **DO NOT** add your name or personal files to the repository.
* ‚ùå **DO NOT** submit duplicate algorithms in the same language. Check existing Pull Requests before working on an issue.
* ‚ùå **DO NOT** make low-effort changes. Your contribution must be a functional piece of code.

**Pull requests that do not follow these guidelines will be marked as `invalid` and closed.**
