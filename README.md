Welcome to **The Algorithm & Data Structure Hub**! This repository is a community-driven collection of common algorithms and data structures implemented in various programming languages. It's a resource for learning and a place for developers to make their first meaningful open-source contributions.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Goals
The mission of this repository is to become a high-quality, community-curated resource for learning fundamental algorithms and data structures. While we enthusiastically participate in events like Hacktoberfest, our primary goal is to create a lasting educational tool for developers of all skill levels. We are committed to maintaining a high standard of quality for all contributions.

## ðŸŽƒ Contributing
