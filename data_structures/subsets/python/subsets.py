"""
Generates all subsets (the power set) of a given set of distinct integers.

Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n)
- There are 2^n possible subsets.
- For each subset, we create a copy of it to add to the result list.
  In the worst case, this copy operation takes O(n) time.

Space Complexity: O(n)
- The recursion call stack can go as deep as n. This does not include the
  space required for the output list itself, which would be O(n * 2^n).
